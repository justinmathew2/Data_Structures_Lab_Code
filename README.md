List of Experiments:

1. Row major and Column Major Address Calculation (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/2BUm0T8RPzA )

    Create a M x N Matrix. Write function for calculating address of a cell in that matrix which is stored in row-major and column-major.

2. Array Implementation of Stack (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/NFh8ZzKFnRo )

    Demonstrate the working of a stack of size N using an array. The elements of the stack may be assumed to be of type integer. The three operations to be supported are: (a) Push, (b) Pop, (c) Display. The program should print appropriate messages for stack overflow, and stack underflow.
