List of Experiments:

1. Row major and Column Major Address Calculation (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/2BUm0T8RPzA )

    Create a M x N Matrix. Write function for calculating address of a cell in that matrix which is stored in row-major and column-major.

2. Array Implementation of Stack (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/NFh8ZzKFnRo )

    Demonstrate the working of a stack of size N using an array. The elements of the stack may be assumed to be of type integer. The three operations to be supported are: (a) Push, (b) Pop, (c) Display. The program should print appropriate messages for stack overflow, and stack underflow.

3. A) Conversion of Infix to Postfix Expression (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/CdtwCYs8ID0 )

    Develop a C++ program to convert an infix expression to postfix expression using stack.

    B) Evaluation of Postfix Expression (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/G0A6C5N3dyY )

    Develop a C++ program to evaluate a postfix expression using stack.

4. Array Implementation of Queue (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/hHqMM01p0O0 )  

    To simulate the working of a queue of integers using an array with the following operations: (a) Insert (b) Delete (c) Display(d) queue full (e)queue empty

5. Implementation of Singly Linked List (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/TyYIbDbNnFs )

    Implement the following operations in a singly linked list: Insertion operation at the front of the list, Deletion of an element from the list, displaying all elements in the list.

6. Linked list Implementation of Stack and Queue (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/KjENb7sTBL4 )

    To simulate the working of a queue and stack of integers using a linked list.

7. Implementation of Linear Search and Binary Search (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/ZOifOjiQOwY)

    To implement the working of implementation of linear search and binary search.

8. Implementation of Insertion and Selection Sort (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/do_6Gz4grGY )

    To implement the working of implementation of insertion and selection sort.

9. Implementation of Hashing (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/TcTiq5PtQbs)

    To implement the working of implementation of hashing.

10. Implementation of Binary Search Tree (Explanation Video Link- https://youtu.be/AftsqAUyA2Q )

    To implement the working of implementation of binary search tree.
